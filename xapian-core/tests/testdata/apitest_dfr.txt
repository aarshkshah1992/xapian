This is a document created for the pl2 weighting scheme for which I need words whose collection frequency is much less than the number of documents in the database.
So,I am going to tweak this database accordingly and put the word john in it about three times and it will contain about 10 documents.

Here is john again.As this document is shorter and,it will come first.john goes for the last time.
